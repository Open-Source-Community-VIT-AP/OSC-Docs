# 📢 Git Session-1

Hey there, welcome to the Git Session-1 documentation. We have compiled the contents on Git and Github for you, so get a step closer to your first open source contribution.

## 🔧 Version Control System, Ever heard of it ?

Consider you are in a project and there constant changes in codes like addition of new modules, fixing of existing bugs, removing of un-necessary or outdated options then, sometimes due to some mistakes, the product goes unstable. then if you have the old code of your project, somewhere(Maybe Cloud/ Secondary Storage Devices) and you can go 
back to the last stable version, it would be very much helpful to you. And this concept is known as version control.

We have different versions of Version Control System, but git is the most popular version control system: 
- Git 
- Mercurial
- Apache Subversion System 
- Monotone
- Bazaar


## 🔧 Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) and Git

The truth is, Git is a distributed version control system. Distributed Version Control System is a type of version control system, where the complete code/files in the repository
including its full history of different versions, is shown on every developer's computer. Using git, a user can make changes to an entire repository on their local system and update it to the server when network is available. Git asks you about the changes you make and stores them as log files, this ensures that no changes can be made without git knowing it so there will not be any problem with managin your previous version of the repositories.

## 🔧 Life with Git

Git supports both :
  1. Command Line Interface (CLI Mode)
  2. Graphical User Interface (GUI Mode)

Guess what: Most Developers Prefer CLI Mode.

### ❔ Why do we even need Git?

  Here are some things to consider about git:
  - Git keeps track of changes made to a file.(makes note of different versions of the same file)
  - It also keeps a note of all the files that are there inside a project
  - Git can compare and analyse different codes with the help of `diff` tool.
  - You can publish your changes offline in your local repository and update it to the server(GitHub) later, so yeah git lets you finish your work even if you are travelling and       have no access to the internet.
  - Every change you make is known to git, the verification of the files is done by decoding the hash codes in your commit.
  
    ***Fact: Every commit is denoted by a unique hash code.***
  
  This is not the end of how git makes your life easier but yeah we won't have enough space for other contents if we continued stating other features of github.
  
  Here is a secret 🤫, checkout [features of git](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-features/).
  
### ⚙️ Getting your hands dirty with Git
  
  This section covers some basics and enough knowledge on how to use git. To work with git or github, you need to have either a local repository or a remote repository.
  
  #### Local Repository ❔
  
   - A local clone of the remote repository which can be done by cloning the remote repository using the `git clone` command, don't worry we will explain more in detail soon.
  
  #### Remote Repository ❔
  
   - A remote repository is the repository hosted on github and it can be cloned and will be accessible to others if the repository is public.
  
  #### Public Repository ❔
  
   - The repository that is open to public to see and make contributions freely. It's open to everyone.
  
  #### Private Repository ❔
  
   - The repository that is not public and has lot of restrictions handled by the owner of the repository. To make a contribution, you need to ask the owner to give you access.
   Note that private repositories are not visible to public, so you can create a private repository if you are working on a secret project 😜.

  Before we go further we suggest you to download the Git CLI version, checkout [resource](https://github.com/Open-Source-Community-VIT-AP/OSC-Talks/tree/main/OSC-Talks-Session-1#Resources-On-Git-And-Github) section for the download link.
  
  #### Configuring Git:

  1. Open Your CMD/ git bash shell
  2. Type the command:     
      ```shell
        git config --global user.name "YOUR GITHUB USER NAME"
        git config --global user.email "EMAIL Address Associated with your github Account"
      ```
      These commands will let the locally installed git know that you are person `xyz` with email `xyz@email.com`. Yeah, now your git client is associated with your account.
      
  #### Some Basic Terminal Commands
  
   Some CMD Commands that you may need for switching directories, creating folders,creating files, opening files,deleting files, deleting directories 
    
  ```cmd

      1. cd Path_Of_Directory        (It changes the current working directory to the path mentioned by you)
      2. cd..                        (It Goes Up by one directory)
      3. mkdir Name_Of_Folder         (It Creates a new folder with the name mentioned by you)
      3. echo >> FileName.FileType    (It Creates a file, with the type/format specified by you)
      4. notepad FileName.FileType    (Opens the file specified by you in the notepad)
      5. rm FileName.FileType         (Deletes the file mentioned by you)
      6. rmdir PathOfTheDirectory     (Deletes a particular folder/directory that was specified)

  ```
      
  #### Working with git on your system:
  
  - #### 👉🏻 Initialization:
  
   First you need to create a local repository, so create a new folder ... now open your command prompt/terminal and migrate to a folder where you want to create a repository.

  > Command:  `git init`
  > 
  > This command will initialize a empty github repository

  - #### 👉🏻 Checking Git-Status:

  To check the git status

  > command: `git status`
  >
  > It will display on which branch you are and say the status of the files in that repo.
  >
  > It will display whether you need to update any files or not.

  - #### 👉🏻 Staging:
  
  Before publishing your changes(Commiting), your files should be added or staged. In short, git tracks the staged files for modifications.
  
  > command:   `git add <filename>`
  >
  > This command will add the file to git's staging directory and hence tracks changes made to the specific file.
  > 
  > Another command: `git add *` (if you put * symbol, all the files will be added)
  
- #### 👉🏻 Committing:

When you commit, git takes a snapshot of the current status of the file and saves it to the git logs. Committing saves your changes permanently.
> Command: `git commit -m "short commit message"`
>
> This command lets you commit with short commit message.
>
> Command: `git commit`
> 
> This command lets you commit with a long commit message. To run this command, you must [set the default editor](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration) for git.

- #### 👉🏻 Pushing:
Here Comes the step after commiting, the `git push` command is used to upload the content on the local repository to the remote repository.

Pushing has the potential, to over write changes, and we should be careful while pushing.

> Command: `git push <remote_Repo> <Name of the branch>`
> 
> Run this command if you are pushing for the first time, to avoid ay errors.
>
> Simpler command: `git push`
>
> This command also works.

### Some advanced git commands

- #### 👉🏻 Stashing:

Stashing is a process in which, your files get stored in a secret place and you can work on it later.
Stashing comes handy when you need to quickly switch context and get working on something else, but you are in the middle of the task and 
not yet completely ready.

> Command: `git stash`

Now you're free to make changes, create new commits, switch branches, and perform any other Git operations;
then come back and re-apply your stash when you're ready.

The tasks that happen after using the above command are: 
 1. Changes that have been added to your index will get stashed.
 2. Changes made to the files, that are being currently tracked by git will be stashed.

 New files that your working copy that have not yet been tracked by git are ignored.
 And, also the files that have been ignored aren't stashed.



 - Adding un-tracked files to git:

 > command: `git stash -u`       
 >
 > This command includes then untracked files.

 > Adding all the files to stash:
 > 
 > command: `git stash -a`        

You can have multiple stashes; it means you aren't limited to one stash

you can run the git stash command multiple times to create stashes.
To View all the stashes made: use the commadn: git stash list
As default, stashes are identifed as WIP (Work in Progress)

So, if all the stashes look same, it's difficult to identify what you've done.
so, adding context to your stash helps:

> command: `git stash save "Stash Message"`
>
> Now to Verify the Context, 
> 
> Command: `git stash list`

Stashing is a local task and it's not pushed to the server when you push.

- Re-applying the stashed changes:

> command: `git stash popular`
> 
> This command removes the changes from your stash, and then re-applies them to your working copy.

- #### 👉🏻 Cloning Repository

> Command: `git clone <remote repository link>`
> 
> This will clone the remote repository to the current directory and now the new repository directory on your machine becomes a local repostiory.
