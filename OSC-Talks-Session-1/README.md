# Git Session-1

Hey there, welcome to the Git Session-1 documentation. We have compiled the contents on Git and Github for you, so get a step closer to your first open source contribution.

## Version Control System, Ever heard of it ?

Consider you are in a project and there constant changes in codes like addition of new modules, fixing of existing bugs, removing of un-necessary or outdated options then, sometimes due to some mistakes, the product goes unstable. then if you have the old code of your project, somewhere(Maybe Cloud/ Secondary Storage Devices) and you can go 
back to the last stable version, it would be very much helpful to you. And this concept is known as version control.

We have different versions of Version Control System, but git is the most popular version control system: 
- Git 
- Mercurial
- Apache Subversion System 
- Monotone
- Bazaar


## Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) and Git

The truth is, Git is a distributed version control system. Distributed Version Control System is a type of version control system, where the complete code/files in the repository
including its full history of different versions, is shown on every developer's computer. Using git, a user can make changes to an entire repository on their local system and update it to the server when network is available. Git asks you about the changes you make and stores them as log files, this ensures that no changes can be made without git knowing it so there will not be any problem with managin your previous version of the repositories.

## Life with Git

Git supports both :
  1. Command Line Interface (CLI Mode)
  2. Graphical User Interface (GUI Mode)

Guess what: Most Developers Prefer CLI Mode.
