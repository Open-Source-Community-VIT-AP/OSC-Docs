# Blender

If you are interested in

Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games. Blender's features include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, rendering, motion graphics, video editing, and compositing.
It's key features include:

-   Blender is a fully integrated 3D content creation suite, offering a broad range of essential tools, including Modeling, Rendering, Animation & Rigging, Video Editing, VFX, Compositing, Texturing, and many types of Simulations.

-   It is cross platform, with an OpenGL GUI that is uniform on all major platforms (and customizable with Python scripts).

-   It has a high-quality 3D architecture, enabling fast and efficient creation workflow.

-   It boasts active community support, see [blender.org/community](blender.org/community) for an extensive list of sites.

-   It has a small executable, which is optionally portable.

## Applications of blender

Can you imagine a bunch of scenarios where the use of 3D models might seem important?  
For people looking to use Blender for video editing, it does just about a little of everything, which means there’s something for video editors, too. Besides rendering amazing effects for your projects, Blender also has a built-in video sequence editor that lets you perform basic editing functions like cuts and splicing—in addition to masking and color grading.

From watching our favorite fluffy boy Baymax of big hero 6 to pointing and clicking heads in tactical FPS shooters, we need 3D models to immerse ourselves, can you imagine a world where animations were restricted to just 2 Dimensions. That's just living in flatland

## Downloading blender

Head over to blender.org and select the download link based on your operating system and CPU architecture, while writing this documnetation the latest blender version is 3.0.

Below is an example of a simple 3D model that are built by beginers. During the course of this event we are going to be building models such as below, and by the end of our episode you'll be able to bring your own ideas to life too.

The abc's of Blender or even 3D modelling are

1. **Object navigation** - Blender allows us to freely move the subject(The selected object) along the X,Y, and Z axes
2. **Object rotation** - Just as the name suggests, we can rotate subjects in blender. There's trackballing and also restricted rotation along the axes
3. **Object scaling** - We often come across situations where we don't always the standard size of the objects, well scaling helps us fit the objects to our desired size
4. **_The 3D curosr_** - The 3D cursor is exactly what it sounds like, it's a cursor in the 3D view. By default it starts in the origin, but you can move it by left clicking. If you add an object, such as a cube or sphere, it will appear where the 3D cursor is.

While the above might seem insignificant to build extraordinary models, but it is always important to remember the basic interactions in 3D building softwares. Let's dive a little deeper and learn more about blender terminology.

1.  **Object mode and edit mode** - Object Mode, This lets you select objects and move them around as you please. Edit Mode, This allows you to select individual vertexes, lines, and planes. you can modify the mesh in this mode.
2.  **Adding a mesh** - A mesh is a collection of vertices, edges, and faces that describe the shape of a 3D object
3.  **Merging** - In edit mode you can select two or more vertexes, and merge them together. To do this, go into edit mode, select the vertexes you want to merge, press "W", then, merge.
4.  **Extruding** - In edit mode, you can select a line, vertex, or plane, and extrude, or, extend it. To do this, select the thing you want to extrude, then press "E"

It's always important to note people who always look at ways to help people with open source softwares.Andrew Price who is the founder of Blender Guru provides free video tutorials for blender.

## Stages of production in Blender:

1. **Scenes and Objects**: Scenes are a way to organize your work. Each blend-file can contain multiple scenes, which share other data such as objects and materials.You can select and create scenes with the Scene data-block menu in the Topbar.
2. **Modelling**: The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, materials and lights. In this part, the first of these is covered, that being modeling. Modeling is simply the art and science of creating a surface that either mimics the shape of a real-world object or expresses your imagination of abstract objects.
3. **Composting**: To process your image, you use nodes to import the image into Blender, change it, optionally merge it with other images, and finally, save it.
4. **Rendering**: If you have come this far, congratulations!. You have close to the ending and flexing your 3D models but before that let's learn how to convert our 3D models to 2D images.Blender includes three render engines with different strengths:
    - Eevee is a physically based realtime renderer.
    - Cycles is a physically based path tracer.
    - Workbench is designed for layout, modeling and previews.  
      What the render looks like is defined by cameras, lights and materials. These are shared between Eevee and Cycles, however some features are only supported in one or the other. Renders can be split up into layers and passes, which can then be composited together for creative control, or to combine with real footage. Freestyle can be used to add non-photorealistic line rendering.

With this we are ready to start making our models.

Just know that wether it is to make a viral animation or make millions by selling your 3D models as NFTs, it's all about thinking big and having fun!
