## How to Explore

Welcome to the Open Source Community's documentation repository!

We gather resources and documentation from our community's speaker and student sessions.
Providing a simple, yet concise guide on how to get started with the concepts that were discussed in the event.

This repository will generally contain the speaker notes, references, an abstract concept overview,
and if we're up to date with what we're doing, a training exercise to get you started as well!
